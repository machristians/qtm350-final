Do more urbanized countries experience higher population growth?

This page explores the relationship between the urbanization rate and population growth rate in four Latin American countries: Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. It compares how different levels of urban development may lead to differences in population growth.

## Results & Discussion 
As shown by the graph, countries with a higher urban population tend to have lower population growth rates, while those with a lower urban population have higher growth rates. Specifically, Mexico and Colombia, which have urban populations below 83%, both exhibit population growth rates above 70%. In contrast, Brazil and Argentina, with urban populations exceeding 85%, have population growth rates below 50%. This suggests an inverse relationship between urbanization and population growth among these countries.
