Specifically, Mexico and Colombia, which have urban populations below 83%, both exhibit population growth rates above 70%. In contrast, Brazil and Argentina, with urban populations exceeding 85%, have population growth rates below 50%. This suggests an inverse relationship between urbanization and population growth among these countries."

These nations were selected for their diverse social, economic, and demographic profiles, offering distinct perspectives on life in Latin America. Through this analysis, we examine how urbanization influences population trends, compare birth and death rates, and investigate other key factors shaping demographic change in the region."

    "text": "In Conclusion,\nAcross all four countries analyzed, birth rates exceed death rates, with Mexico showing the highest natural population growth and Argentina the lowest. Urbanization appears inversely related to growth—Mexico and Colombia, with lower urban populations, have higher growth rates, while Brazil and Argentina show the opposite.\nColombia stands out with a notably high adolescent fertility rate relative to its overall fertility rate, suggesting early-age childbirth is more common. Additionally, Brazil shows a higher child mortality rate than the others, signaling potential health or socioeconomic concerns.\nOverall, despite the limited sample size, distinct demographic patterns emerge, highlighting significant regional disparities in growth, urbanization, and health outcomes."

Its adolescent fertility rate is disproportionately high compared to its overall fertility rate, indicating that Colombians aged 15-19 give birth more than would be expected compared to the rest of the Colombian population.\nThis trend is confirmed in other studies, which attributes the high adolescent fertility, in part, to Colombia’s “illegality of abortion”(Daniels 2015)."
