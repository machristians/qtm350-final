title: "Fertility rates among adolescents"
---

Which countries have a disproportionately high adolescent fertility rate?

This page explores the patterns of fertility rate (overall, and just among adolescents) in four Latin American countries: Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.

## Results 
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Connect to sql
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/wdi_data.db')  

# SQL query
query = """
SELECT 
    country,
    population_density,
    under_5_mortality_rate
FROM wdi_data
WHERE population_density IS NOT NULL AND under_5_mortality_rate IS NOT NULL;
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

display(pd.read_sql(query, conn))

```

```{python}
#| label: natural_rate_barplot
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| fig-cap: "Birth Rate vs. Death Rate "



# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.scatterplot(
    data=df, 
    x='population_density', y='under_5_mortality_rate', 
    hue='country',
    s = 300
)

plt.title('Child mortality vs. Population density')
plt.ylabel('Deaths under 5 y.o. per 1,000 live births')
plt.xlabel('People per sq. km of land')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## Interpretation 
There isn't an obvious trend between child mortality and population density, but we can see from this plot that Brazil's child mortality rate is particularly high compared to the other three Latin American countries.

Brazil's high child mortality rate is observed in other studies, which attribute it to insufficient prenatal care in the country [@francca2017leading].
