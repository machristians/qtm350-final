```{python}
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Connect to sql
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/wdi_data.db')  

# SQL query
query = """
SELECT 
    country,
    birth_rate,
    death_rate,
    (birth_rate - death_rate) AS circle_of_life
FROM wdi_data
WHERE birth_rate IS NOT NULL AND death_rate IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY circle_of_life ASC;
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

display(pd.read_sql(query, conn))

```

```{python}
